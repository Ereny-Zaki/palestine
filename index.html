        * There are many forms of solidarity that citizens can offer to our Palestinian brothers all over the world including translating the details of the Palestinian issue into multiple languages to disseminate it widely, collecting in-kind and material donations
         and continuing to pray for them to strengthen their feet and grant them victory over their enemy.<br>
        <br> * also launched intense campaigns to boycott all companies, shops and restaurants around the world that support the Israeli occupation in its ongoing aggression against the Gaza Strip
        after some international companies showed sympathy and provided material and moral support to Israel, despite everything that the Palestinians are exposed to.<br>
        <br> * Some citizens also launched campaigns to support our Palestinian brothers
         by being assigned to work in their place until the crisis passes in areas of remote work such as content writing and marketing.<br>
        <br> *Our brothers in Palestine need financial support so that they can confront the Zionist enemy, which enjoys unlimited moral and material Western support.<br>
        <br>* The resistance won the media battle, and the evidence of this is the global sympathy that Gaza and Palestine enjoyed during the days of the ongoing aggression on the Gaza Strip, and many activists and influencers on social media sites demolished the lies of Netanyahu and Biden, and fiercely confronted the media misinformation campaigns, and exposed the blind bias towards Israel.
